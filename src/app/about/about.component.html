    <h1>A little bit about me....</h1>
    <p>My name is Barbara Birmingham. I am a software developer. I make software. 
        This website is largely a way for me to learn something about Angular and 
        Python and then to show that new skill off to you, my potential employer.
        So I hope you enjoy playing with the toys I create here!</p>
