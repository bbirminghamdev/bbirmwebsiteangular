    <p>This page hosts a Twitter Sentiment analyzer. It was generated using the nltk python library and exported via pickle, then restored on demand here. The training dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 100,000 random records were selected for training. A random selection of 100 tweets are then pulled from the Twitter API and run through the model. 
        <br /><br /> 
        In a future iteration of this page, I will post the selected tweets and their sentiment.
